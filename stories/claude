Here is a short story about the unending traffic in Dubai:

The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless sea of cars that crawled along the highways of Dubai. Sami sighed as he glanced at the clock on his dashboard - he had already been stuck in traffic for over an hour, and there was still no end in sight. 

As far as the eye could see, vehicles of every make and model inched forward at a glacial pace, their drivers growing increasingly impatient. Horns blared intermittently, adding to the cacophony of sounds that filled the stifling air. Sami drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, trying to distract himself from the growing frustration.

He had hoped to be home by now, relaxing with a cool drink after a long day at the office. Instead, he was trapped in this automotive purgatory, surrounded by the fumes and noise of thousands of other commuters in the same predicament. 

Sami leaned back in his seat, resigning himself to the fact that it could be another hour or more before he finally reached his destination. This was the price one paid for living in a city that never seemed to sleep - the constant, unrelenting traffic that was the bane of every Dubai resident's existence.

As he inched forward inch by inch, Sami couldn't help but wonder how much of his life had been consumed by these interminable traffic jams. It was a thought that filled him with a sense of melancholy, a realization that the precious minutes and hours of his day were being slowly sapped away by the city's insatiable appetite for cars and congestion.

But for now, there was nothing to do but wait it out, to be patient and resigned to the fact that this was simply the price of living in one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing cities in the world. With a deep sigh, Sami settled in for the long haul, his eyes fixed on the endless line of taillights stretching out before him.
